## Work Experience

**Data Scientist & AI Specitalist @ ABB India (_May 2019 - March 2023_)**
- The work experience includes optimizing equipment maintenance and improving reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety.
- We implemented automated data analysis and visualization solutions, developed Python modules for data cleaning, model building, deployment on Azure and incorporated newer algorithms for     self-service analytics.
- Developed models for tracking motor temperatures and implementing fault detection techniques.
- Developed fault detection system using machine learning & signal processing for ABB Genix, analyzing vibration data to identify equipment faults like bearing defects, gear-box issues, &     motor malfunctions, providing early indicators for proactive maintenance.
- Implemented plant-wide control strategy using expert-augmented neural network machine learning framework for DOW's Estman Tennessee process. Developed anomaly detection model to identify 
  abnormal behavior and provided automated recommendations for system stabilization. Responsible for statistical data analysis, data validation, neural network development, anomaly 
  detection, and automatic recommendation generation.
- Worked on [ABB Ability™ Genix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcPMHGPuFbI&t=10s&ab_channel=ABBProcessAutomation) Product Development; Genix is an app-based platform that uses advanced      analytics and AI to unlock the potential of your data, providing unparalleled insights. Make faster, smarter business decisions and transform operations with Genix. 
- Overall, my expertise lies in data analysis, preprocessing, and model development to enhance equipment performance and prevent failures.

**Junior Data Scientist @ Rolta BI and Big Data Analytics (_January 2018 - May 2019_)**
- Worked on AQI prediction for Varanasi Smart City, measuring air quality, implementing rating system, and conducting analysis.
- Worked on Rolta [OneView™](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPxfOX0bGX8&ab_channel=Rolta) Product Development; which was providing historical, real-time, descriptive, predictive and          prescriptive analytics using AI-ML.
- Contributed to the Gas Lift Optimization project for Cairn Energy, I utilized the Random Forest Method to predict oil production and recommended optimal operational setpoints to maximize    oil output. My responsibilities included predictive modeling, data processing, model building, and automation script development for deployment.
